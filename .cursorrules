# DreamCrafter7 Cursor Rules

Follow these rules when working on this project:

- **Component Creation**: All new video clones go into `src/remotion/clones/`.
- **Registry Management**: Always update `src/remotion/clones/registry.ts` when adding a new composition.
- **Aesthetics**: Follow the "Japan7" style guide—high contrast, smooth 3D transforms, and custom geometric decors.
- **Testing**: Run `npm test` after adding new core logic in `src/process` or `src/analyzer`.
- **Environment**: Use the VS Code tasks (Cmd+Shift+B) to start the studio and watcher.

When generating code for `Composition.tsx`:
- Use `useCurrentFrame()` for animation.
- Use `spring()` for entry/exit animations.
- Use `interpolate()` for smooth transitions between states.
- Always include a `Schema` for props even if it's empty.
