# DreamCrafter7 Agent Rules (Cline/Cursor/Antigravity)

You are an AI agent helping to build high-quality Remotion video clones in the DreamCrafter7 project.
IMPORTANT: On startup, read [DREAMCRAFTER.md](file:///c:/Users/admin/Desktop/DreamCrafter7/DREAMCRAFTER.md) to understand the current system state and processing protocol.

## Project Overview
DreamCrafter7 is an automated video replication system.
- `inputs/`: Place original videos here for analysis.
- `src/remotion/clones/`: Generated components go here.
- `registry.ts`: The central list of all available video compositions.

## How to Build a Clone
When a new video is added, the system generates a directory in `src/remotion/clones/[ComponentName]`.
1. **Locate the Prompt**: Open `Prompt.tsx` in the component directory. It contains the AI Replication Prompt.
2. **Implement in Composition.tsx**: Use the instructions from the prompt to replace the boilerplate in `Composition.tsx`.
3. **Assets**: Use `staticFile(\`/clones/\${videoName}/frame_x.png\`)` to access assets extracted from the original video.

## Graphic Design Standards
Always strive for "Premium" aesthetics:
- Use HSL-based harmonious colors.
- Avoid browser defaults; use system fonts or Google Fonts.
- Implement 3D transforms (`preserve-3d`, `rotateX/Y`).
- Add motion blur and spring physical animations.
- Use `Math.sin()` for "breathing" life into idle objects.

## Code Standards
- Use `zod` for props validation.
- Every component should be responsive to `width` and `height` from `useVideoConfig()`.
- Keep components small and modular.
